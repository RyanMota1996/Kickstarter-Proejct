# Louis KickStarter campaign

## Project Overview and Purpose
The oveview of the project is to relay to Louis when is the best time to lauch their kickstarter, and what is the funding amount will yeild the best ouctome for it. furthermore, the main purpose of this analysis is two-fold. Firstly, it is to gauge when the most beneficial time is to launch a fundraising Kickstarter for a theatre play, and secondly to give louis a pricing budget that is most likely yield a successful fundraising campaign for their project.

## Anaylsis and Challanges
The analysis was preformed under several steps. Firstly, the data had to be cleaned, this involed colour coding the 'outcome' coloum, as well as coverteding the dates from *Epoch* into something that can be understood at a glace. After this, we then proceed to setup several tables and charts with the relevant information, anything pertaining to theatre/play as well as their outcome.(see image 1)

From this, when then were able to display the trends within the data presented. One of the first graphs created was the graph which displayed the total amount of Kickstarters in each category (see image 2). Another challenge that occurred was that the volume of data and pages also caused operational issues with the excel program, causing either slow downs or crashes. Furthermore, another issue faced was that the use of pivot tables and graphs were new to us, and thus having to use them for the first time caused problems with their implementation at first.

## Results and conclusion 
For all purposes, it appears that those that ask for more, are more likely to fail, and those who ask for less, are more likely to have a successful fundraising. This can be seen in the ‘outcomes’ line graph. Furthermore looking at the outcomes vs launch dates graph, it appears that those who campaign in the summer(Q2) are more likely then any other period of time (see 'Theather Outcomes by Launch date'). Thus, from the information provided, it can be concluded that if Louis wants to successfully fundraise the project, they have to firstly, start campaign in Q2 and secondly ask for $20,000-$24,999. Under these two parameters, it can be said that their likelihood of successfully kickstarting their play is more likely then not. So in conclusion, the best advice from the data provided and be summerized as to tell Louis that it would be best if they launch their campagin in the Summer while budgeting for roughly $20,000, and if this is met, to later place a stretch goal

## Limitation and Confounding Factors
There are several limitations of the data is that it does not account for, due to the nature of the online landscape and online fundraising as a whole. That is positive and negative online word of mouth spread very quickly and public interest can be gained via other means such as social media. This issue could skew the data presented and thus cause the inflation of successful kickstarters. For example, there were several extreme outliers who garnered over $50,000 each. one of these  projects were launched by [April Yvette Thompson](https://www.linkedin.com/in/aprilyvettethompson) and the other [Jim Beaver](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0064769/). These two people are already famous and successful people using this online platform to gain funding for their project, and can firstly, boost out their message more and secondly may have wealthier people interested in their projects as they already have a history of writting and producing. On the other hand you have people asking for $100,000,000 with a description of *"My ambition for this knows no bounds.  Seeing Sephoria in a live-action is a dream of mine."* These two factors of already famous people asking for fundrasing who already have a proven track record and secondly having random people asking for money creates extremes in both directions. Another issue is that there is an inheret memetic properties of the internet allow for certain random trends to become very popular which can lend itself to inherently unpredictable events, this should be taken into consideration before attempting to create any online fundraising effort.
